Welcome to Ben Lloyd's GitHub repo for ESS 569 - Machine Learning in the Geosciences.
Access the course textbook [here](https://geo-smart.github.io/mlgeo-book/about_this_book/about_this_book.html).

## Favorite Geoscience Topics
My research centers around vegetational responses to environmental change in deep time. Plants are sessile organisms, and thus their morphologies and chemistries are closely tied to the climates in which they live. I study these relationships through two primary avenues:
1. I am currently working to understand how Australia went from mostly forested (just 10 million years ago!) to mostly grassland today.
2. I have spent a significant amount of time tracking how plant traits vary in response to changing environmental conditions, to develop paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental proxies.
